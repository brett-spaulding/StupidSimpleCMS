##### Are you tired of complicated Content Management Systems that make you want to chemically labotomize yourself? Do you dream of a system so simple, even a caveman could use it?

Well, dream no more! Introducing Stupid Simple CMS - the markdown-driven CMS that's as easy to use as a toaster!
We've all been there. Clicking through menus, trying to figure out why our blog post isn't publishing... it's like trying to solve a puzzle blindfolded while running from an assailant that's trying to extract your kidneys!


##### But not with Stupid Simple CMS! With our system, you can create and publish content with just a few clicks. And by 'just a few clicks', I mean literally 3 clicks. Maybe 4 if you count the click to save your work.

Your're probably thinking "Wow, this is so easy! How do I add a new page?"


##### "Just type in the markdown for your content and click 'Publish'!"

And that's it! Your page is live, and you didn't have to hire a team of IT experts or sacrifice a goat to our reptilian overlords to get it there.
I've heard everyone you know say "I was skeptical at first, but Stupid Simple CMS has changed my life. I can now focus on creating content instead of wrestling with my intrusive thoughts."


##### "Don't wait any longer! Get Stupid Simple CMS today and start publishing like a pro (or at least, like someone who's actively disappointing their parents)!"
